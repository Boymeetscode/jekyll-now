Hi there, welcome to my blog. I've been meaning to start one of these things for a while now and just haven't quite found the time. With the inspiration and help of my friend Nerm, I got this thing running with Jekyll and hosted up on Github Pages.


I'll be completey honest here: my informal writing completely sucks. I highly doubt more than a handful of people will ever lay eyes on this blog, though I felt it should be said. The main purpose here will likely be to detail the projects I'm working on and the thoughts I have regarding business and, occasionally, politics.


Most of all, I'm just glad to put my domain, [boymeets.world](http://boymeets.world), to use.
