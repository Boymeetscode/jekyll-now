A few months back in December I dove deep into the history of a little known computer company, NeXT. While few people may know about NeXT, the company played a vital role in the computer revolution. After Steve Jobs was dismissed from his position at Apple in 1985 he wanted to target the education market with a high powered machine. The end result was NeXT's first and one of only two computers: the NeXTCube. Eventually, a failing Apple would go on to acquire NeXT in 1996 for a total of $400 million. While NeXT was solely a declining software company by this point, the acquistion's main purpose was the rehiring of Steve Jobs and many key NeXT employees such Avie Tevanian.

I was facinated by what I was learning but stuggled to find media and information about NeXT in a single central location. I took it upon my self, for the next three weeks, to locate and archive any media and history relating to NeXT. The end result is thousands of files that paint an image of NeXT throughout it's history.

A publically viewable archive of these files is availible at [nextcomputer.org](http://nextcomputer.org); the site I created as a homage and marker for NeXT. To ensure the safety of the files, most are backed up not only with third parties but with [archive.org](http://archive.org), as well.
