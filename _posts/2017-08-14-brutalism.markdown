About a year or so ago I developed an affinity for a certain style of web design. It was rugged and raw; nothing like the over loaded, JS lathered websites of today. In saying this I probably sound like an angry, old developer who is fed up with the requirements of modern web design. Though, the truth is these websites remind me of what I love about the web. Anyone with a keyboard and a vision can create something virtually anyone can access.

I recently discovered this style is being classified as Brutalism in web design. After hearing this, it all made sense. This classification stems from the mid-twentieth century architectural style which emphasizes rawness and zero-frills; known simply as Brutalism. Coincidentally, I've also been a long-time admirer of Brutalist architecture. It only makes sense I would be drawn to this trend in web design.

Now this concept of straight to the point and purposeful websites is actually not even new. Sites like Reddit and Hacker News are praised for their designs and are actually considered as unintentional Brutalism. Other mainstream sites like Bloomberg and The Outline embrace the more modern and bright versions of Brutalism in web design. The design community has become increasingly more and more aware of brutalist web design. Fortunately, I seem to not be alone in admiration of the style. Sites like [brutalistwebsites.com](http://brutalistwebsites.com) and [uxbrutalism.com](http://uxbrutalism.com) have appeared in recent months.

However I am worried about the strings attached to classifying something like this. Articles and sites about the style encourage others but also inadvertently push standards and constraints. Most people I've spoken to who created technically Brutalist sites had no intention of actually creating a Brutalist site at all. This brings me to my closing point: I really enjoy everything Brutalism in web design has to offer but hopefully those who start to use Brutalism as a framework, stick to the core value of building sites which are raw and purposeful.

Note: [Here's](http://www.pierrebuttin.com/work/brutalist-redesigns/) an interesting post from a guy who redesigned some popular apps in  Brutalist style.
