In the past six months or so I've developed a passion for photography. More specifically, film photography. There is just a certain essence to film and it helps satisfy my, as the Germans say, Sehnsucht for times I have not lived in. Fortunately, the world of film is not lost and there is a large community which validates it's existence today. Though, the main point of this specific post is not to highlight my passion for film photography, but it is to document the realization I had as a relatively new photographer.

Unlike most my passion for photography did not begin when I picked up a camera and felt enormous possibility. It began simply by viewing the works of others. While it may seem stereotypical, when I first laid eyes on Ansel Adam's "Monolith, the Face of Half Dome" I was immediately captivated by it's contrast and incredible range. In fact, captivated does not even begin to describe how I felt. But it was from this moment that I began my descent into photography.

From there, I began observing and following the works of who I would consider my greatest inspirations. Photographers like Tag Christof, Patrick McCormack, and Carson Gilliland; each gave me so much inspiration for what was to come. Unfortunately, somehow inspiration turned into mimicking in my mind. I became so caught up in trying to replicate their themes and styles that I forgot what I was actually doing. My so called passion for photography somehow turned into theoretical plagiarism.

As a result I hated my work; I thought it was terrible. It took a while but finally realized that I was expending all my effort into trying to replicate my inspirations styles rather than letting experience and experimentation shape my own. After this my confidence boosted and I began shooting what I really wanted to. This not only made me a happier person but, I think, a better photographer.
