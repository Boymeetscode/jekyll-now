I honestly had no intention of making this blog into anything personal. I tend to think of myself as a not so personal person (if that even makes sense). I very seldom talk about my thoughts with other people just out of the pure lack of desire to share. Though, I had a pretty bleh day and for god knows what reason I've decided to write here.

Something that I always subconsciously knew but never wanted to admit is that in order to feel happy/sufficient I needed to be occupied with some other purpose. Whether that purpose was a startup project, freelance work, or even fun personal projects, it didn't really matter. As long as I was doing *something* I would be mostly content. This summer is the first time I've been faced with a lack of general purpose. I won't get into the semantics of it all but this summer has been rather dissatisfying.

I picked up film photography as a main hobby and I've actually really enjoyed that. Though I've felt very self conscious about my work. I'm not sure if this is just due to not quite finding my niche in photography, comparing my self to much more experienced photographers, or just general self consciousness around ones work. I'm hoping this changes over time and I begin to feel more confident with my work.

School is quickly approaching in less than 4 days and I'm actually kind of looking forward to it. I'm thinking it should help keep me occupied as I'm really not doing much else; at it's core I think that's the real problem. I've always felt the need to be doing something worth talking about and am having to come to terms that I will not always have something to occupy me.

Note: If this post is riddled with errors, I apologize. I wrote it at 1am.
